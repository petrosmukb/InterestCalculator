# Interest rate calculator

This is a .net core 2.2 console application that takes an amount and returns an interest rate base on the amount. 

## Build & Run

Using CLI inside the solution folder
```bash
dotnet build (to build the both projects)
dotnet test (to run the tests)
dotnet run  --project .\InterestCalculator\InterestCalculator.csproj (to run the app)

```

## Design Considerations  
- Data Access: This is a mock repository to save and retrieve the interest rates. In a real case scenario this could be a database or a cache storage.
